# RockPaperScissors-with-Tkinter
## Rock Paper Scissors game. Player vs. Computer. Tkinter to be used for the GUI. 

This was completed as a final project for the [November for Python Learners](https://sites.google.com/view/itexperience-python-class/home) with ITexperience.org.

The basic outline was to consist of:

5 buttons (rock, paper, scissors, reset and exit), the rules, results display and the winner after ten plays.

I completed these requirements then customized as best as tkinter would allow, with my beginner's knowledge. I added two pages using frames - a welcome page, with the rules of the game and then two options: single or streak.

Choosing 'single', runs the RPS game till player or computer score 1pt, then the rock, paper, scissors buttons go inactive and the reset button becomes active to take player back to the start page. 

Choosing 'streak', is similar to choosing single, except the RPS game runs till the player or computer scores 10pts, before the buttons get disabled/enabled.

There's an exit button present on all pages as well. I wanted to use a gif of like an explosion for when the exit was clicked, but I haven't figured that out yet.
